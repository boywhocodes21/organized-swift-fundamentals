//Conditional Statements

/*Swift provides two ways to add conditional branches to your code: the if statement and the switch statement. Typically, you use the if statement to evaluate simple conditions with only a few possible outcomes. The switch statement is better suited to more complex conditions with multiple possible permutations and is useful in situations where pattern matching can help select an appropriate code branch to execute.

//Switch
/*A switch statement considers a value and compares it against several possible matching patterns. It then executes an appropriate block of code, based on the first pattern that matches successfully. A switch statement provides an alternative to the if statement for responding to multiple potential states.

//No Implicit Fallthrough
/*n contrast with switch statements in C and Objective-C, switch statements in Swift donâ€™t fall through the bottom of each case and into the next one by default. Instead, the entire switch statement finishes its execution as soon as the first matching switch case is completed, without requiring an explicit break statement. */

//Interval Matching
/*Values in switch cases can be checked for their inclusion in an interval. This example uses number intervals to provide a natural-language count for numbers of any size:
