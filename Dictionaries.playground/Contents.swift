// 3 ) Dictionaries
//A dictionary stores associations between keys of the same type and values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering.

//Dictionary Type Shorthand Syntax
/*The type of a Swift dictionary is written in full as Dictionary<Key, Value>, where Key is the type of value that can be used as a dictionary key, and Value is the type of value that the dictionary stores for those keys.

//Creating an Empty Dictionary

// namesOfIntegers now contains 1 key-value pair

//Creating a Dictionary with a Dictionary Literal
var airports: [String: String] = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]

//Accessing and Modifying a Dictionary
