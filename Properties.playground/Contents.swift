import UIKit

//Properties

//Properties associate values with a particular class, structure, or enumeration. Stored properties store constant and variable values as part of an instance, whereas computed properties calculate (rather than store) a value.

//Stored Properties
struct FixedLengthRange {
    var firstValue: Int
    let length: Int
}
var rangeOfThreeItems = FixedLengthRange(firstValue: 0, length: 3)
// the range represents integer values 0, 1, and 2
rangeOfThreeItems.firstValue = 6
// the range now represents integer values 6, 7, and 8

//Stored Properties of Constant Structure Instances
let rangeOfFourItems = FixedLengthRange(firstValue: 0, length: 4)
// this range represents integer values 0, 1, 2, and 3
rangeOfFourItems.firstValue = 6
// this will report an error, even though firstValue is a variable property

//Lazy Stored Properties
/*
 A lazy stored property is a property whose initial value isn’t calculated until the first time it’s used. You indicate a lazy stored property by writing the lazy modifier before its declaration.

 */
class DataImporter {
    /*
    DataImporter is a class to import data from an external file.
    The class is assumed to take a nontrivial amount of time to initialize.
    */
    var filename = "data.txt"
    // the DataImporter class would provide data importing functionality here
}

class DataManager {
    lazy var importer = DataImporter()
    var data: [String] = []
    // the DataManager class would provide data management functionality here
}

let manager = DataManager()
manager.data.append("Some data")
manager.data.append("Some more data")
// the DataImporter instance for the importer property hasn't yet been created

//Computed Properties
/*
 In addition to stored properties, classes, structures, and enumerations can define computed properties, which don’t actually store a value. Instead, they provide a getter and an optional setter to retrieve and set other properties and values indirectly.
 */

//Property Wrappers
//A property wrapper adds a layer of separation between code that manages how a property is stored and the code that defines a property

@propertyWrapper
struct TwelveOrLess {
    private var number = 0
    var wrappedValue: Int {
        get { return number }
        set { number = min(newValue, 12) }
    }
}
