//Swift provides a variety of control flow statements. These include while loops to perform a task multiple times; if, guard, and switch statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions; and statements such as break and continue to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code

//For-In Loops

    // render the tick mark every 3 hours (3, 6, 9, 12)
